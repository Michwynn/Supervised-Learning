# Supervised-Learning

This repo includes notebooks that pertain to several supervised learning techniques: Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Machines, kNN Classifiers, and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees Classifiers, along with evaluation metrics using Grid Search

**Supervised_Learning - Regression and Classification.ipynb**
Description: Built a few regression and classification models to learn how model complexity relates to generalisation performance. The regression techniques used include linear, polynomail, lasso and SVC. We used the aid of visualisation through scatterplots to determine generalisation performances of each model, including evaluating their r^2 scores. 

**Supervised Learning - Evaluation Metrics using Grid Search.ipynb**
An extension of the above notebook, similarly I built several classification models and calculated some metrics to assess the performance of these models. However, this scenario entails a "spam" e-mail detection which is a widely-used supervised machine learning task that attempts to find unsolicited, mass-produced messages that have irrelevant and/or inappropriate content (often mass marketing or attempts at fraud). These are sometimes called "spam filters".
